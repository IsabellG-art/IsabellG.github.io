<h1>They go finish the errand</h1>

<p>While they head back to the shop they notice that something is happening at the diner.</p>
<p>As the table it headed twoards them Blaze takes out his sword and slices the table in half</p>
<p>But as he sliced the table in half he noticed a mouse looking sad and sees that not only did he slice the table in half but slice the mouse's staff in half</p>
<p>Blaze offers to pay for his meal, and Vixey mentions that they work at a sword shop and can try to fix or make a new staff.</p>
<p>The mouse likes that idea and gets the rest of his meal to go and follows both of them to the <a href="shop.html">shop</a>.</p>

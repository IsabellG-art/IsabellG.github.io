<h1>They go to the shop</h1>
<p>All three Nibbles,Blaze and Vixey head to the shop. As they arrive the fox family greets Nibbles, and Blazes' parents apologise for breaking the staff.</p>
<p>While waiting for Blaze and his father make 2 different staffs, Nibbles asks a question to Vixey.</p>
<p>He questions how Blaze got that scar by his eye. Vixey answers by saying that when he was 14 and she was 16, she went to get something from the back a badger came trying to steal a sword.</p>
<p>Blaze ended up fighting him and the badger stabbed him close to his eye, but luckly a ranger bear helped Blaze.</p>

<p>After talking to Vixey and playing with Blazes' siblings Blaze and his father finish making the staffs' for Nibbles.</p>
<p>Nibbles has a hard time choosing a staff.</p>
<p> The first one has a piece of his old staff, <a href="light.html">light</a>-weight, with a place for the cheese to be placed surrounded by metallic shapes that resemble grasshopper legs.</p>

<p>The second one is more metalic, a bit more <a href="heavy.html">heavy</a> but twice as powerful, with a place for the cheese.</p>

<p>While eating his meal a customer causes a scene for not paying his tab and has destroyed many tables and chairs.</p>
<p>The customer throws a table at a nearby family and you cast a cheese bubble spell which saves the family, but the table bounces over to a window with 2 nearby foxes on the outside.</p>

<p>The cheese bubble spell used most of his magic but the table is headed their way.</p>

<p>So, he decides to <a href="throw.html">throw</a> his staff (as a way to transport the table outside)</p>
